This condition can be caused by various factors, such as infection, inflammation, or injury. The presence of atelectasis in the lower lobes of the lungs can lead to reduced lung function and may cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough, and chest pain. In some cases, atelectasis can also be a sign of a more serious underlying condition, such as pneumonia or lung cancer. Further evaluation and testing may be necessary to determine the cause of the atelectasis and"
