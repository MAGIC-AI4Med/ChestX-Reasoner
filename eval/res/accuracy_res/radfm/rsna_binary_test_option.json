It is an apparent sign of pneumonia seen in a frontal chest radiograph. The sign is produced by a circular lucency, which forms between the pneumonia and the chest wall. This lucency is round and has a smooth inner margin. The outer margin is produced by the interface between the area of pneumonia and the normal lung parenchyma. The sign is best seen in the frontal view, and is best visualized anterior to the heart. The \"reverse hamburger bun sign\" can be seen in the left upper lobe, right middle lobe, and right lower lobe, and is best seen in the setting of pneumonia and effusion."

Influenza is the most common viral pneumonia.  Influenza B is usually milder than influenza A.  However, severe complications may occur with influenza B, especially in elderly people.

Classically, lobar pneumonia appears as a focal dense opacification of the majority of an entire lobe with relative sparing of the large airways. There may be additional associated areas of ground-glass opacity in a lobar or segmental pattern, likely representing areas of partial involvement or simply atelectasis. On contrast-enhanced CT, pneumonia often enhances less than atelectatic lung, although there is no clear Hounsfield unit threshold to distinguish the two. For example, one small study used a threshold of 85 HU to distinguish between atelectasis versus pneumonia on CT PE protocol with a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 92%. However, there is overlap, and also factors such as pulmonary hemorrhage and underlying malignancy likely affect the lung density. \nThe answer is No."

        "pred": "The abnormality is a supradiaphragmatic \"mass\" on the left.  This may be a single loculation of pleural fluid, or pneumothorax, or even a lung mass or abscess.  The first thing to consider is whether this is a problem that requires immediate attention: Is it safe to delay?  If the answer is No, then immediate action should be taken to determine the nature and source of the abnormality.  If the answer is Yes, then the cue to order a chest CT scan is the presence of a fluid collection that extends above the diaphragm.  This could be a pleural effusion or blood in the pleural space from trauma.  The other possibilities are a pneumothorax or lung mass which are associated with a diaphragmatic defect.  The differential diagnosis can be narrowed by the clinical history.  For example, a chest film that shows a fluid collection after surgery should be treated as an abscess until proven otherwise.  The same is true for a chest radiograph that shows significant subcutaneous emphysema.  The point is that the radiologist cannot sit back and think about the differential; the radiologist must make a definitive attempt to determine the source of the abnormality and then order a CT scan to confirm the diagnosis.

A cavitary lesion is a cavity in the lung that is caused by an air-filled space within the lung tissue.  High-attenuation nodules are clusters of cells that resemble normal lung tissue in the right lung.  Low-attenuation nodules are areas of dead tissue, or necrosis.  \r\n\r\n2) Is the lesion well-defined or ill-defined? Ill-defined refers to an area that has indistinct borders or contours.  This may be difficult to distinguish from surrounding lung tissue.  Conversely, a well-defined lesion has a distinct border, and is easier to identify from surrounding lung tissue.  \r\n\r\n3) Does the lesion show signs of pleural effusion? Pleural effusion refers to an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space around the lungs.  If there is pleural effusion, it may be difficult to identify the underlying lesion.  \r\n\r\n4) Does the lesion show signs of pneumothorax?
