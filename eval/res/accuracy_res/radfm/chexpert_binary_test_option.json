The radiographic findings for cardiogenic pulmonary edema are often indistinguishable from non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema.  However, it is important to differentiate these two diseases due to different treatment regimens.  Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema can be seen in patients with renal failure, liver disease, pneumonia, or after transfusion.  It is important to differentiate non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema from cardiogenic pulmonary edema because treatment regimens are different.  \r\nCardiogenic pulmonary edema is caused by cardiac decompensation (most common cause), acute myocardial infarction, and left to right shunts.  Common radiographic findings of cardiogenic pulmonary edema include pulmonary alveolar opacities, increased interstitial markings, Kerley B lines, and edema stripes.  The most common cause of cardiogenic pulmonary edema is heart failure.  In acute myocardial infarction, the heart can cause dilatation of the left ventricle"

This is a very non-specific finding, and could be due to a number of different conditions.  \r\n\r\nThe next step is to look at the pattern.  If there is a homogeneous increase in markings diffusely throughout the chest, one can consider interstitial edema.  However, if the increase is only localized to certain areas, then one should look for masses (consolidation, nodules, or ground-glass opacities), which are not seen here.  The final step is to consider the pattern in relation to the patient's clinical history.  If the patient has lupus, and the pattern is diffuse, increasing markings, then this is compatible with lupus profundus.  However, if the patient has a history of breast cancer, and the pattern is diffuse, increasing markings, then one can consider metastatic disease.  The bottom line is that the differential is very broad based on the CXR alone, and it is necessary to do a thorough clinical evaluation to narrow the differential."

So, the first thing we notice is that the lungs and mediastinum look normal, and that gives us the first option of our 2-step process.  We can stop at this point and answer \"No\" to the question.  But, if we look closer, we see that there are tubes and lines in the mediastinum that are asymmetric - that both look like they are shifted to the left.  That makes us stop and think about what might be causing that shift.  The next thing we notice is that the patient has a tube in her right side of the neck and healed rib fractures that are on the left side of her body.  That gives us the second part of our 2-step process.  We now know that there is a good chance this is a \"No\" answer.  But, we continue to look around the tubes and the lines, and we see that there are some rough spots near the ends of the tubes and wires.  That makes us stop and think about"

We need to look for evidence of an enlarged cardiomediastinum in this supine AP film.  What is the first thing to look for in an AP supine chest x-ray?  Look for evidence of an enlarged cardiomediastinum.  This is usually a sign of an enlarged heart or an enlarged mediastinum.  In an AP supine film, the heart usually does not appear enlarged unless the film is taken from the side (the heart is usually surrounded by bones and soft tissue which makes it appear smaller).  So, the first thing to look for is an enlarged mediastinum.  This can be identified by comparing the size of the mediastinum to the size of the heart.  If the mediastinum is larger than the heart, there is usually a problem.  Look at the edges of the mediastinum.  Is there a large amount of soft tissue surrounding the bones"

It is true that there is a problem, but we need to look at where the mediastinum is deviated, and in what direction.  The mediastinum is deviated to the left.  This is a very strong indicator that there is a problem with the left-sided structures.  This could be a hernia, or a hematoma, or even a hernia within a hematoma (think about a hematoma compressing a vascular structure, and how that would deviate the mediastinum).  The other thing that is important to think about is that there is no deviation of the mediastinum to the right.  This would suggest a right-sided pathology, and would be a good reason to consider a right-sided pathology, but there is no evidence of that.  So, the first step is to look at where the mediastinum is deviated, and in what direction, and to think about the structures that are causing that deviation.  In this case, it is deviated to the left.  The next thing to do is to look at the various structures that are important for the differential diagnosis.

Now, let's answer the question.  The patient has an enlarged cardiomediastinum.  Is that a good sign? No, it is not a good sign.  There are many causes of an enlarged cardiomediastinum.  It could be due to a pericardial effusion, or aortic aneurysm, or left ventricular hypertrophy, or pericardial cyst, or mediastinal cyst.

It is a relatively radiolucent space between an extremely dense object (the chest wall) and the lung, which is usually radiolucent.  So, the air in the pleural space stands out.  An air-fluid level would not look like this.  An air cyst would not look like this.  So, we should look for an air-density space in the pleural space.  This should be relatively thin at the apex, and get thicker as we move towards the lung and the chest wall.  This should be bilateral, unless there has been surgery to alter the anatomy.  There should not be any soft tissue in the pleural space.  Now that we have seen the appearance of a pneumothorax, we need to think about what would make it disappear.  The first thing to do is to locate the chest tube.  That should be obvious where it is, and it should have suction applied to it.

In a true AP projection, the mediastinum should be of the same length, no matter what the rotation of the film is.  This is not the case in this film.  The left atrium is rotated to the left.  There is no way that the mediastinum could be longer in an AP projection.  The second thing to consider is that if this film was truly an AP projection and there was a concern for mediastinal enlargement, the physician would have obtained a PA film.  No concern for mediastinal enlargement was present, therefore this film was not an AP projection.  Finally, we need to consider the anatomy.  It is true that the aorta and left ventricle are longer in an AP projection.  However, in a normal adult, the left atrium is also longer in an AP projection.  This film shows marked enlargement of the left atrium.  The third and fourth images demonstrate the abnormality.  Because of the rotation of the film ("

In addition, the renal vein is more vertical in its course.  Once you are satisfied that the renal vein is not a normal venous structure, you can then ask if it is a shunt.  A shunt is a connection between two body parts that should not be connected.  A persistent renal vein is a connection between the renal vein and the inferior vena cava.  It is a normal structure in the fetus, but should not be present in an adult.  If it is present in an adult, it is termed a left-to-right shunt, since the shunt allows blood to bypass the normal capillary bed in the lung.  The presence of the renal vein in an adult is an indication of an abnormality in the cardiac or pulmonary circulation."

Look at the distribution of blood (if hemorrhage), and where the mass or abnormal density is located. Look for patterns, and be sure to consider the age and gender of the patient. Once you have done this, you can then focus on the area in question. In this case, the first thing to look for is an effusion. An effusion is a fluid collection in the pleural cavity. It can be caused by many things, but malignancy often causes large, unilateral (often left sided) effusions. Look carefully at the radiograph and compare the size and shape of the opacity to the rest of the chest. Is the opacity homogeneous (uniform) or heterogeneous (not uniform)? Is it rounded or some other shape? Once you have done this, compare the opacity with the normal chest. Is there anything else in the chest that draws your attention? Once you have done this, consider where the opacity is in relation to the chest wall, the mediastinum, and the ribs. Is the opacity density the same as the adjacent ribs? Once you have done this, consider the shape and where the opacity is located. Is it rounded, and is it smooth or rough? Once you have done this, consider the outline of the opacity. Is it well"

Recurrent miscarriages are seen in up to 25% of SLE patients.  \r\n\r\nThe next step is to obtain a chest CT scan.  This will help further evaluate the nodular densities, and will also help rule out other causes of pleuritic chest pain, should the chest radiographs be inconclusive."

For example, the opacity could be atelectasis, pneumonia or contusion; the edge could be sharp or blunt; the effusion could be hemorrhagic or transudative and so on.  The key is to remember that when you have 3 separate findings, you should be thinking about 3 separate differential diagnoses.  This is where the \"Etiology\" of the finding is critical to your thinking process.  You should always be thinking about the most likely process given the patient history and presentation.  In this case, the patient has an opacity (A), an edge (B) and an effusion (C).  What do they represent?\r\n\r\nOPACITY:  Tendon rupture vs tenosynovitis vs tendinosis vs extension splint\r\nEDGE:  Could be from a sharp metallic foreign body vs penetrating trauma vs surgical instrumentation\r\nEFFUSION:  Could be from"

A hernia may be present through a posterior or anterolateral defect in the hemi-diaphragm.  A posterior defect may be the result of a congenital abnormality of the diaphragm.  Anterolateral defects are more commonly associated with trauma.  The herniated abdominal contents are usually the ipsilateral, but may be contralateral or even bilateral.  The herniated contents are usually lung, but may also be intestine, retroperitoneal fat, kidney, or liver.  The most common solid organ herniated is the spleen.  Bochdalek's hernia is the second most common type of diaphragmatic hernia after Morgagni's hernia.  Bochdalek's hernias are usually not detected at birth.  Bochdalek's hernias are usually found incidentally on radiographs in children or adults.  Bochdalek's hernias are usually located posteriorly, but may be located an"

The problem is that the patient has an inappropriately positioned support device.  There are several possible causes, but the first step is to recognize that there is a problem.  Once the problem is recognized, then we can begin to think about possible solutions.  In this case, the patient may have been moved to different bed, or the bed may have been adjusted, so that now the patient feels more comfortable.  This may include moving the head board up or down, or moving the foot board up or down.  However, sometimes, despite our best efforts, the patient still has difficulty fitting into the \"standard\" bed.  This may be due to the patient's anatomy, or perhaps the patient has a very tall, large body, and the bed is not tall enough.  There may be times when the patient needs to be intubated, and this may also cause problems with the support devices, due to the weight of the tubing, or the tubing may become caught under the patient's arms, etc.  There may be times when the patient needs to be turned, and this may also cause problems with the support devices, due to the weight of the patient's body, or perhaps the tubing is caught under the patient's arms, etc. "

The history of mild shortness of breath and the absence of purulent discharge from the throat suggest a diagnosis of pneumonia.  This is the most likely cause, but a follow-up chest x-ray in 4 weeks after treatment is recommended to ensure resolution.  If the opacity doesn't resolve, CT of the chest is recommended to exclude a mass."

One of the causes is the presence of an inappropriately positioned endotracheal tube.  It is not uncommon for an ET tube to be placed too deeply, since the measurement of the distance between the ET tube and the carina is not routine.  Distance is measured with the patient's neck in neutral or extension.  The average depth of an ET tube is 2. 5 cm above the carina.  The depth of an ET tube may vary with neck position.  When the neck is flexed, the ET tube moves closer to the trachea.  When the neck is extended, the ET tube moves away from the trachea.   This variation is due to the effect of gravity on the trachea and ET tube.  The patient in this case had a neck extension, and the ET tube was too deep.  One of the problems of an ET tube that is too deep is that it may cause atelectasis of the lung above the ET tube.  This is due to the fact that the ET tube is so deep that it prevents the normal inspiration that would cause the inflation of the lung above the tube.  Ate"

If the patient has acute edema, she/he will usually have a rapid onset of symptoms and signs, such as dyspnea (shortness of breath), cough, and decreased urine output.  On the other hand, if the patient has chronic interstitial lung disease, the symptoms and signs will be more subdued, and may mimic those of a chronic disease.  If we look at the patient's history, we see that the patient has a history of smoking.  This increases the risk of developing chronic lung disease such as emphysema, but it also increases the risk of developing heart failure which can lead to acute pulmonary edema.  However, if we look at the patient's vital signs and physical exam, we see that the patient's shortness of breath has decreased over the past 3 days, and the patient has not had fever or cough.  This points towards a chronic disease rather than acute pulmonary edema."

In this case, there is a small, linear, plate-like atelectasis seen at the left base (Film .1Z).  This is a very common finding in patients who have recently been extubated, and it is probably due to the fact that the head and neck are displaced in this position, preventing proper inspiration into the left lower lobe.  Next, look at the right base (Film .2Z).  There is a small, linear, plate-like atelectasis seen at the right base as well.  Extensive pleural calcifications are also seen at the right base, but since these occur at a progression over time, they are not likely to cause atelectasis.  There is also a small, punctate, calcification in the right lung apex (Film .3Z).  This is due to the fact that the apical lung is the most dependent portion of the lung, and since the patient is lying flat, there is not enough time for the body to redistribute fluids adequately, causing a small plate-like atelect"
