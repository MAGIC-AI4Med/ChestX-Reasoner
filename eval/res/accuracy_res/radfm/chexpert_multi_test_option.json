Other findings may include cardiomegaly or pulmonary edema.  Other clues on the chest x-ray include widening of the vascular pedicle and deviation of the trachea.  Also, there may be evidence of previous heart surgeries such as sternal wires or other hardware.  This information is useful in determining the patient\u2019s history.  If there is a sternal wires, you would expect there to be a history of coronary artery disease.  The history would be important in determining the reason for the surgery.

This is due to increased vascularity, and is often due to the body\u2019s response to protect injury in one area of the chest.  The final thing to look for is any signs of injury to the ribs, spine, or thoracic cage.  This involves looking for fractures, and if found, determining if they are single or multiple, and if they are displaced or non-displaced.

The \"double contour\" sign is seen on a frontal radiograph. It is a result of the ascending aorta being compressed against the spine by the retrosternal goiter. In addition, the right paratracheal stripe will be obscured. There is a \"double contour\" in the tracheobronchial angle. The left main bronchus will be displaced to the right. The left main bronchus is compressed by the left atrium. There will be an increased right paratracheal space. The left atrium is often enlarged in aortic dissection."

There may also be evidence of right ventricular dysfunction, which is variable and nonspecific.  A persistent inferior wall abnormality is thought to be the most common, and is present in up to 35% of patients with PE.  Other ECG findings include persistent ST segment depression (15%), persistent Q wave (15%), and persistent T wave inversion (10%).  \r\n\r\nThe"

However, if it is a large wedge shaped opacity, it may indicate a pulmonary infarct from a embolism or pulmonary embolism. The third finding is the number of pulmonary vessels going into the opacity. If there are many vessels, it is probably not atelectasis. Atelectasis is a radiologic diagnosis of exclusion. The fourth finding is the loss of bronchovascular markings.

There was no atelectasis in this case.\n\nThe third thing we look for is lung lesion.  This is not likely in the case of bilateral opacities.  If there is a lesion, it will often obscure the heart border.  In this case, the cardiomediastinum was enlarged.\n\nThe fourth thing we look for is pulmonary edema.

A lesion in the lower lung field is a chest xray that is difficult to read.  Next look at the left upper lung field and see if there are any lesions.  Also look at the right lung field.  If there is cardiomegaly, then look for pleural effusion.  This will help you to look at the lower lobes for a lesion.  Dont forget about the complications of a pulmonary embolism.

The second thing we look for is atelectasis. Atelectasis is the collapse of lung tissue. It can be caused by many different things, but it is a frequent complication of pulmonary edema. It is also seen in the setting of pleural effusions and after lung or chest wall surgery. Atelectasis can be either linear or platelike. It is important to differentiate atelectasis from pulmonary contusion. The two can look similar, but the diagnosis can be made with confidence if you look carefully at the lung margins. A contusion will typically have blurred margins and may have associated hemorrhage.  The third finding is an enlarged cardiomediastinum. There are many causes of an enlarged cardiomediastinum.

The defect should be in the shape of a circle because the pericardial space is under tension and the fibrous roots of the pericardium are closely opposed. The pericardial defect may be missed if the scan is taken at end-diastole. This is when the cardiac valves are closed and the atria are contracted. The defect may be missed because the atria are contracted and the contracted atria may pull the pericardium and heart closer together. The atria may even pull the pericardium and heart up against the chest wall.

These tests are more sensitive, and will determine the size of the heart in both diastole and systole.  \r\n\r\nSecondly, it is important to look at the lungs.  There should be no opacity, and the lungs should be symmetrical.  There should also be no pleural effusion.  Extremities should be examined for edema.  If edema is present in the extremities, it is important to remember that this can be a systemic process, and therefore the heart may also be enlarged.  If there is no edema present, and the heart is enlarged, it is important to think about cardiac etiologies that may cause the heart to be enlarged.  One such cause is pericardial effusion.  There are many causes of pericardial effusion, and this can be a systemic process.

You need to look at the patient's medical history to determine if any of these are likely.  If the patient has a history of aortic stenosis, then you would expect the heart to be enlarged.  Also, look at the patient's age.  Is the enlargement sudden or gradual?  If the enlargement is sudden, consider acute myocardial infarction or rupture of the left ventricular apical aneurysm as the likely cause.  If the enlargement is gradual, then you would consider pericardial effusion, cardiomyopathy, or pericardial tamponade as the likely cause.  \r\n\r\nAfter you have determined the likely cause, you need to look at the size of the heart in different imaging modalities.  On chest radiographs, the heart is enlarged when the cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) is greater than 0. 5.

The lungs are clear and there is no pleural effusion.  There are no fractures that are identified.  The soft tissues are remarkable for multiple bilateral linear densities.

Another cause is trauma, including the blow of a knife to the chest.  This is unlikely, as the patient has multiple wounds to the chest and extremities, and would be very difficult to hide a knife.  Another cause is a lung disease such as TB, which would likely be seen in the chest x-ray.  Another cause is penetration of the chest by a foreign body, such as a nail.

In order to do this, we need to break down the findings into two categories.  The first category is called \"focal\" and is defined as \"a localized area of inflammation, often with a central core of infection.\" The second category is called \"diffuse\" and is defined as \"a spread of inflammation from a central point often in the chest wall.\" Thefocal type of pneumonia is much less common than the diffuse type.  The focal type is usually due to an infection from an esophageal source.  The diffuse type is most commonly caused by aspiration of gastric contents into the lung.  The diffuse type is more common, however, the focal type is more severe.  Therefore, treatment for focal pneumonia is usually more aggressive than for diffuse pneumonia.

There are a variety of pathologic processes which may present as an abnormality in the chest radiograph.  It is important to remember that a chest radiograph is a very broad diagnostic test, and it is often difficult to make a specific diagnosis based on radiographic findings alone.  Therefore, it is important to correlate radiographic findings with the patient\u2019s clinical presentation and history.  A differential diagnosis can be created by considering the radiographic appearance of the abnormality, and the patient\u2019s clinical history.  The differential diagnosis can then be narrowed as further diagnostic tests are performed.  A complete differential diagnosis can be seen in the accompanying table (Table 1).  \r\nOnce we have a better idea of the differential diagnosis, we need to determine whether there are any radiographic findings that can help us narrow down the possibilities.  One of the most helpful things to look for is a correlate on the radiograph to the patient\u2019s clinical history.  For example, if a patient is presenting with fever and cough, we might see a consolidation on the radiograph that correlates to the patient\u2019s clinical presentation.

        "pred": "The first thing to look at is the chest X-ray.  There are multiple findings at play here.  Loss of the left hemidiaphragm and the left heart border, blunting of the left costophrenic angle, elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, and some mediastinal shift to the right, as well as atelectasis of the left lower lung zone.  There is also the presence of consolidation in the left upper lobe with associated volume loss.  Overall, this is a very impressive CXR.  There are some additional findings, such as the multiple rib fractures, some subcutaneous emphysema, and some pneumomediastinum.  However, the main take-home message is that this patient has a very impressive CXR.  There are multiple findings, some of which are consistent with a flail chest, while others are not.  The next step is to delve into the specifics of flail chest.  The definition of flail chest varies, but it usually implies that there is an injury to the chest wall and/or lung that results in the collapse of the ipsilateral lung and the displacement of the heart and mediastinum away from the injured lung.  The key is that the lung, heart, and mediastinum are not restricted in"

        "pred": "The first thing we look for is cardiomegaly.  Cardiomegaly is a chest x-ray finding associated with left ventricular enlargement.  The causes are many, and include: congestive heart failure, high output cardiac dysfunction, and aortic stenosis.  In the case of aortic stenosis, the left ventricle hypertrophies to compensate for the stenotic valve.  This hypertrophy then causes an increase in left ventricular mass, and the left ventricular cavity is filled with contractile tissue rather than trabecular tissue.  This leads to an enlarged cardiomediastinal outline on chest radiographs.\r\n\r\nThe next thing we look for is changes in vascularity.  We look for signs of high cardiac output.  The heart rate is often between 125-150 beats per minute.  The heart is trying to compensate for the stenotic valve by pumping blood at a greater rate.  This increased heart rate leads to increased vascularity.  We look for signs of pulmonary venous congestion.  This usually manifests as upper lobe vascular redistribution.  There is also a possibility of bilateral diffuse alveolar edema.  This can be seen as"

There is no pneumothorax. Pleural effusion is also a possibility, but not a very likely one. Consolidation is a possibility, but not a very likely one.
