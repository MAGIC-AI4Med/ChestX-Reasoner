If it were an anterior mediastinal mass, you should consider thyroid lesions as the most common cause, with a quick follow up to exclude a malignant lesion.

Atelectasis is often seen with general anesthesia, and pleural effusion can be seen with many causes, including heart failure, pneumonia, cancer, and post-surgical causes. A focal left lower zone opacity with loss of the aortopulmonary window would make a lung malignancy likely, with bronchogenic carcinoma being most common and melanoma being the most uncommon.

If there is no evidence of trauma, you can move on to looking for medical conditions that can cause atelectasis.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to look at the x-ray and see if there is any consolidation.

Next most common is a lytic bone lesion caused by a metabolic disorder, such as renal osteodystrophy.  Renal osteodystrophy typically causes multiple lytic lesions in the ribs and other areas of bone (white arrows).  Renal osteodystrophy often shows an increase in the size of the bone (e.g. metaphyseal widening) and a coarsening of trabeculae. \r\n\r\nThese are only a few of the many causes of lytic lesions.  The key is to look at the whole radiograph and compare it to previous radiographs if available.  It is helpful to have a broad differential because the initial evaluation of a lytic lesion often does not yield a definitive diagnosis.  The radiologist should be able to see if the lesion is metastatic, if it is benign, and if it is secondary to another disease.  The radiologist can also play a role in diagnosis by noting areas that are suspicious for lytic lesions and referring the patient for additional evaluation."

E is for Edema and Effusions, where the fluid accumulates in the pleural or pericardial spaces.  ARTI is for Arterial and Venous Thrombosis, which may cause a blockage in the arteries or veins.  CT is for Computed Tomography, a diagnostic imaging tool that uses X-rays to create detailed pictures of internal structures.  Finally, the T in HEART is for Tachycardia and Tachypnea, which are fast heart rates and shallow breathing.  Now that we have a brief overview of HEART, we can apply it to our case.  The chest x-ray shows cardiomegaly, bilateral pleural effusions, and enlarged pulmonary vessels.  This suggests a high likelihood of congestive heart failure (CHF).

Chest tubes should be attached to wall suction and the tubing should be checked to make sure it is patent.  If the location of the chest tube is not clear, then the tubing should be followed from the chest to the wall suction.  It is possible to follow the tubing from the suction and then trace it back to the chest to determine where the tip of the tube is located.  A large amount of air will be pulled into the suction, so it is important to suction at 10 cm water or close to it.

The second thing to look at is the shape of the heart.  The cardiac silhouette should never appear smaller than the width of the trachea - and it does.  This is called the \"bell shaped heart.\"  The third thing to look at is the shape of the lungs.  The lung bases should always be visible - no matter how shallow or deep the patient may be.  This is called the \"basal index.\"  In this case, the lung bases are obscured and the costophrenic angles are obscured.  This is a sign of atelectasis.  This is a very sick patient."

Lastly, look for any chronic findings that may have been missed or ignored in the workup. This will help you better understand the patient's overall condition.\r\nOnce you have worked through the radiograph, you must consider the patient's clinical presentation. Is this a reproducible finding? Will it be found on other radiographs? Will it be seen on a radiograph at all? Is there a good explanation for it?

        "pred": "The first thing we look for is a fracture.  There are many clues in the x-ray that help us to look closer. The first is the \"line of demarcation\", a line that separates the normal bone from the abnormal bone.  In this case, it is the right heart border that is deviated inferiorly by the compression from the outside.  We also look for the \"sentinel clot\", a thin line of high density that is deposited in the area where the bone was disrupted.  This is seen in the image adjacent to the right inferior pulmonary vein.  We look for signs of \"fallen fragment\" - that is, a fragment of bone that has fallen from its normal position.  This is seen in the image adjacent to the right superior pulmonary vein.  The final consideration is that of a \"pneumothorax\", a space between the lung and the chest wall that is filled with air.  This would appear as a black line under the pleura, that is, at the interface with the air.  Note the arrows pointing to each of the abnormal findings."

Thickening of the bronchovascular bundles can also be seen.  It is important to note, however, that the cardiac shadow may be normal in pulmonary edema. \r\n\r\nThe third finding is pneumonia.  This is an inflammation of the lung parenchyma, usually caused by an infection.  The radiographic appearance of pneumonia varies according to the organism causing the pneumonia.  It is often possible, however, to see areas of consolidation or air bronchograms in a consolidative pattern.  A consolidative pattern of pneumonia is when the air is replaced by fluid, and the lung becomes solid.  This is called replacement uplasia.  Air bronchograms are the fourth finding.

If you look at the left base, there is a similar appearance of atelectasis, with volume loss and a slightly blunted costophrenic angle.

Also, atelectasis usually demonstrates no or slight volume increase, while pneumonia often has pleural effusion.  The other major difference is that atelectasis usually demonstrates complete opacification, while pneumonia only partial opacification.

Visible visceral pleural edge is seen as a very thin, sharp white line. No lung markings are seen peripheral to this line. Peripheral space is radiolucent compared to the adjacent lung. Lung may completely collapse. Mediastinum should not shift away from the pneumothorax unless a tension pneumothorax is present. Subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum may also be present.

The second most common finding is pneumomediastinum (66 percent). This is usually seen in the anterior mediastinum and may extend into the posterior mediastinum. It may also extend into the soft tissues of the neck. The third most common finding is pneumoperiostitis (26 percent).

Atelectasis can be due to a variety of factors, such as pulmonary embolism, lung cancer, or airway obstruction.

The pathophysiology behind the wedge-shaped consolidation is complete vascular occlusion cutting off blood supply to lung tissue, causing infarction. There is also aadrenergic dilation of the pulmonary artery afterload that further increases the pressure in the pulmonary artery. This also increases the strain on the afterload and results in further vascular occlusions. Hampton's humps are typically located in the peripheral lung, and are large and wedge-shaped. There are multiple case reports of Hampton's humps with a single large wedge-shaped consolidation that mimics a pulmonary infarct, pneumonia, or lung contusion. \r\n\r\nThe diagnosis is Hampton's hump"

Plain films are insensitive in detecting radiopaque foreign bodies, but metallic foreign bodies are highly radiopaque and will be seen.  An occult foreign body can be identified if there is an associated fracture, soft tissue swelling or hematoma.  Flat radiographs are useful for identifying radiopaque foreign bodies with a metallic density greater than 500 HU.  Ultrasonography and CT are useful in detecting radiolucent foreign bodies.  X-rays are typically performed in the emergency department.  AP and lateral views are used to visualize radiopaque foreign bodies.  A radiopaque foreign body with a metallic density greater than 500 HU can be assumed to be a metallic foreign body.  For radiopaque foreign bodies, radiographs are considered positive if they are larger than 1 cm; smaller radiopaque foreign bodies may not be seen.

Look at the patients' history; if he or she has a history of trauma, think about other injuries that may be associated with blunt force to the chest, such as rib fractures, sternal fractures, or aortic aneurysm.  Look at the patient's chest X-ray; if there is a significant amount of soft tissue swelling at the posterior-lateral aspect of the chest, this may indicate a hemothorax.  Look at the patient's vital signs; if the blood pressure is 100/60 mmHg, there may be a hemothorax.  Look at the patient's vital signs; if the respiratory rate is 30 breaths per minute, there may be a hemothorax.
