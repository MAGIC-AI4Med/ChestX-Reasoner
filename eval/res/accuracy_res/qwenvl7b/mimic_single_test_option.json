Cardiomegaly refers to an enlarged heart, which would be visible as a larger than normal heart silhouette. Lung opacity is a general term for any abnormal density in the lungs, which could be due to various conditions including consolidation or edema.\n\nUpon examining the image, the lungs appear to have a more opaque appearance, suggesting the presence of increased density or fluid.
