If there is no acute process, we need to consider chronic causes such as COPD, asthma, and lung fibrosis (usually interstitial).  If we are still without an answer, we should look for a disorder that may be causing a transudative pleural effusion such as CHF (heart failure), or a malignancy such as lung cancer.  Finally, we should consider a congenital cause such as Marfan's syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.  \r\n\r\nOnce we have identified the most likely diagnosis, we need to determine if there are any radiographic findings associated with it.  In this case, there are associated findings such as hilar adenopathy and enlarged cardiomediastinum.  Also, there may be a specific finding such as a hilar mass or calcification which may point to a particular diagnosis.  The final step is to look at any laboratory tests that may help with the diagnosis.  In this case, the patient had a positive PPD and the radiologist performed a biopsy for the adenopathy - both"

There are two types of atelectasis:\r\ncomplete or complete atelectasis\r\npartial atelectasis or partial upper lobe or lower lobe atelectasis\r\n\r\nThe most common cause of atelectasis is the failure of the diaphragm to descend properly, resulting in an inability to move the chest wall, which may cause atelectasis of the entire lung or a portion of it (atelectasis of the upper or lower lobe). Other causes include bronchial obstruction, mucous plugging, foreign body aspiration, and muscular weakness. Atelectasis can also occur when pleural effusion or congestive heart failure cause pressure to build up behind the diaphragm, preventing proper expansion.

The first thing we look for in a chest X-ray are the support devices. In this case, there is a tube coming from the mouth and a tube going into the abdomen; these are the endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube respectively.

The interlobar artery is usually the most prominent single feature.  The right heart border is usually more prominent than the left.  There is often a double density to the right heart border.  Is there any deviation of the trachea?  Is the trachea seen as two parallel thin white lines?  Is the left main bronchus visible as two parallel thin white lines?  Look over the top of the mediastinum - is there an impression of a prominent aortic arch?  Look at the bottom of the mediastinum - are there two prominent convexities?  The first impression is often the right descending aorta, just above the right main bronchus.  The left arch is usually less prominent.  On lateral views, the aortic arch is usually more than 2cm from the tracheal air column.  There is an impression of a double density to the trachea - is the right side seen as two"

The mediastinum is important because it tells you a lot about what is going on inside the chest. Enlargement of the mediastinum suggests a pathologic change in the chest.  Next, you look for a focal consolidation.  Focal areas of increased density on a chest radiograph are usually an indication of inflammation or infection.  It is important to remember that focal consolidation can be a very subtle finding, and the radiograph may be normal.  In this case, you are looking for a focal consolidation within the atelectatic lung.  There is a great differential for a focal consolidation, but it is not appropriate for this case.

They may also show linear branching (interlobular septal thickening), which is commonly seen in pulmonary edema.  \r\n\r\nSecondly, we look for a fracture (yellow arrow).  This is often seen as a linear lucency that crosses the bone at an angle.  It is important to look for any displacement, or the degree of displacement.  If there is no displacement, it is likely a simple transverse fracture.  A minimally displaced fracture is still significant, and should be treated with a sling and a suture.  A markedly displaced fracture is likely to require orthopedic surgery.  It is important to look at the bone as a whole, and to look at the proximal and distal aspects of the fracture.  If there is no fracture, then we look for a mass (blue arrow).  A mass is likely to be smooth, rounded, and hom"
