In order to have a pneumothorax, there must be an air-filled space between the lung and chest wall.  In order to measure the space, one needs to identify the visceral pleural line.   This is a thin, almost imperceptible line seen in the chest radiographs.  It is the pleura that lies adjacent to the lung parenchyma.  This line is most often seen as a faint white line in the lateral lower chest.  It is best seen on the lateral CXR.   When measuring the space, one needs to measure from the most lateral aspect of the visceral pleural line, to the most medial aspect of the ribs.   One does not measure from the visceral pleural line, but rather from the most lateral aspect of the pleura.   For example, if the patient has a pneumothorax, and you measure from the most lateral aspect of the pleura, to the most medial aspect of the ribs, you will see a space between the lung and chest wall.

In this case, the left costophrenic angle is blunted and the meniscus of the pleural fluid is visible.  The most common cause of a spontaneous pneumothorax is a ruptured bleb.

The rib fracture can be a subtle cortical defect or may have significant displacement.  The key to diagnosis is the localization of the fracture and the demonstration of a pleural defect.

It is a radiologic sign in which a border is partially or completely obscured by a nearby object.  In this case, the left heart border is partially obscured by the presence of the posterior rib.  \r\n\r\nThe silhouette sign can also cause confusion during the interpretation of a chest radiograph.  This is called the \"curtain sign.\"  You can think of it as a \"black curtain\" causing a shadow in the theater.  It can be seen with atelectasis or effusion (see above).  \r\n\r\nThe silhouette sign is a very useful tool to assist in the diagnosis of a pleural effusion.  It can help differentiate the fluid from the adjacent lung.  For example, if you look at the radiograph, the left heart border is very clearly defined despite the presence of a left pleural effusion.  This is because the effusion is contained within the \"black curtain\" of the left lower lobe, allowing the left heart border to be clearly outlined by the air in the superior lobe.  The same is true for the right heart border and the silhouette created by the posterior ribs.  \r\n\r\nThe silhouette"

This will help you to search for patterns, and to look for potential clues that may point you in the direction of diagnosis.  \n\nThe 3rd image shows what appears to be a catheter in the esophagus.  This could be related to the fact that the patient has a nasogastric tube, or it may be due to the fact that the patient is supine and fluid has pooled in the distal esophagus.  But, this is where the search for the 4th image came in.  It showed a nasogastric tube that was clearly within the stomach.  This told you that the initial placement of the nasogastric tube was in the distal esophagus, and over time, the patient moved.  But, it also raised the question of what else may be going on.  Does the patient have a gastric outlet obstruction?  Is there some other catheter in the esophagus?  Are there balloons or other devices that may have been placed during the surgery?  All of these questions are legitimate, and may help to direct your search in finding the most likely diagnosis.   \n\nHaving said all"

The heart size can be normal.  You don't need to see an acute cause such as pneumonia, pneumothorax or pulmonary embolism.

The most common cause of cardiomegaly is left ventricular dilatation.  This can be seen in conditions such as aortic stenosis, but also in a variety of cardiomyopathies (congestive, ischemic, etc.) as well as in pericardial effusion.  In the case of aortic stenosis, the valve orifice is narrowed, and the pressure gradient across it is high.  This results in the development of hypertrophy of the left ventricle, with the interventricular septum being most affected.  The hypertrophied septum displaces the confines of the left ventricle, causing dilatation of the posterior and basal segments.  This results in a \"spade-like\" appearance of the left ventricle, with a \"double density\" appearance of the left heart border.  The CXR in this case demonstrates these findings.  Structural causes of cardiomegaly are the most common, but functional causes also matter.  In the case of aortic regurgitation, the left ventricle fills to a high stroke volume, resulting in dilatation. "

If there is a collection of fluid behind the heart, it is called a hydro-thorax. It can be caused by a number of things, including a ruptured esophagus. If there is pleural fluid, it is called pleural effusion. It can be caused by many things, including heart disease, lung disease, kidney disease, and liver disease. Also, the image alone cannot confirm the cause of the pleural effusion. It is important to consider the patient's medical history.

In the case of pleural effusion, it is important to differentiate between loculated and free fluid.  This is because the treatment for the two is different.  If there is a loculated effusion, the two options are to either chest tube the area to get rid of the fluid or to place a pigtail catheter in the area of the effusion.  However in the case of free flowing fluid, a chest tube is the treatment of choice.  After placing the chest tube, the next step is to find out if there is an underlying cause for the effusion.  This is because if there is a known cause, such as intra-abdominal fluid, then the source can be treated.  However if there is no known cause of the effusion, the patient will need to have an evaluation of the heart, the lungs, and the abdomen to find a cause.  The final answer to this question is \"Is there pleural effusion present or not?\" If there is fluid present, is it loculated or free flowing?

The fracture line is smooth, long, and linear, characteristics of a pathologic fracture.  There is displacement of the distal fragment laterally, with non-visualization of the distal fragment lying in its expected anatomic location, Shenton's line.  The second image shows the patient with a cane, and the fracture is more displaced than when the patient was not using the cane.  This indicates that the fracture is unstable.  The third image shows an abductor muscle, the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle, and surrounding soft tissue edema.  This is consistent with a partial avulsion of the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle from the medial condyle of the femur.  There is no displacement of the muscle, however.  The fourth image shows the patient with a cane, and the fracture is less displaced than when the patient was not using the cane.  The fracture is stable.  The fifth image shows the patient with a cane, and the fracture is less displaced than when the patient was not using the cane."

One type of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema is after rheumatoid arthritis, and this can be due to an inflammatory reaction, causing swelling in the lungs.  There are many other causes, and they are often seen in combination with other medical conditions.  A good example is the use of tPA in acute stroke.  \r\ntPA is a thrombolytic agent used to dissolve blood clots in acute stroke.  One of the common adverse effects of this medication is bleeding.  This usually occurs at the site of the clot, causing a petechial hemorrhage.  However, about 1/3 of patients will have diffuse pulmonary bleeding.  This diffuse pulmonary bleeding can mimic other causes, such as hemorrhage, causing confusion in the diagnosis.  A good example of this is the case of Stroke.  \r\nStroke is a clinical diagnosis, meaning that it is"

The interstitial edema is due to fluid in the lung interstitium.  Fluid in the interstitium will mostly be shown as ground glass opacities or a reticular pattern.  \r\n\r\nNon-cardiogenic pulmonary edema is most commonly seen in patients with renal failure, but it can also be seen in patients with hepatic failure, fluid overload, and pneumonia (most common cause in children).  The radiographic findings of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema are alveolar edema with normal or decreased interstitial edema.  So the question becomes, how do you differentiate cardiogenic from non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema?  One way to differentiate cardiogenic from non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema is the presence of opacification of the inferior vena cava (IVC).  If the IVC"

It is important to consider that the mediastinum can also be widened by non-cardiac causes such as bleeding, infection, neoplasms, inflammation, fluid, and air.  Thus, it is important to look at the patient clinically to determine whether any of these are likely.

Features of pulmonary edema include upper lobe pulmonary venous diversion and a widespread, bilateral, granular, ground-glass pattern. Differentiation from interstitial pulmonary edema is often difficult. The heart size may be normal despite severe alveolar pulmonary edema. A clue to the diagnosis may be a history of severe pulmonary edema in a patient who is subsequently found to have normal to increased pulmonary artery pressure.  Interstitial pulmonary edema is most commonly demonstrated by ground glass opacification, bronchovascular bundle thickening, interlobular septal thickening. Alveolar edema is demonstrated by airspace consolidation in addition to the above findings. Pleural effusions are a frequent accompanying finding in cardiogenic/hydrostatic pulmonary edema.\nThe answer is Yes."

Either there is an effusion and it is on the left side or there is an effusion and it is on the right side.  In the first case, the chest x-ray may show a hazy or veil-like appearance with a sharp, well-defined medial border.  This is because the fluid is confined to the pleural space.  There will not be any significant displacement of the mediastinum or trachea.  However, an abrupt tapering may be noted at the lung base, which is suggestive of the pleural effusion.  There is also some suggestion of fluid in the oblique fissure.  Veil-like density is noted in the left hemithorax.  These findings suggest left-sided pleural effusion.  There are two possible answers to this question.  Either there is an effusion and it is on the left side or there is an effusion and it is on the right side.

There should not be any sharp or abrupt changes in the contour of the diaphragm, and there should not be any lung markings above the diaphragm. If we look at the cardiphrenic angle, we see the normal descent of the diaphragm at the interface with the chest wall. In the normal situation, the diaphragm is convex, and its apex is approximately 2 cm above the intersection of the mid-clavicular line with the chest wall.\r\n\r\nNow, if we look at the lung fields, we see that the normal lung fields should not extend above the diaphragm. The problem is, how do we know where to \"cut\" the image? The answer is to use the silhouette sign. If the lung markings are still present in the region where the heart should be, then we know that there is an abnormality. The lung markings should not extend above the diaphragm, no matter where the apex of the heart is. If they do extend above the diaphragm, then we know that there must be air in the pleural space.\r\n\r\nThis problem is easier to see on a lateral chest radiograph. You can confirm"

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is defined by the presence of clinical syndrome, electrocardiographic changes, and positive cardiac enzymes.  The most common cause of AMI is a thrombotic occlusion of a coronary artery.  It is important to look at signs of acute stroke in the brain.  Stroke is defined as the sudden onset of a clinical syndrome, lasting more than 24 hours.  Signs of acute stroke include: 1) neurologic deficit, 2) loss of sensation, 3) loss of motion, and 4) slurred speech.  There are two main types of stroke: ischemic and hemorrhagic.  It is important to differentiate between the two.  \r\n\r\nAcute stroke is treated with tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) in certain cases.  The treatment window is within five days of symptom onset.  The mainstay of treatment for AMI is thrombolysis and coronary intervention.  After the patient has been treated for AMI, he/she needs to continue taking his/her medications, such as aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme"

The blunting of the costophrenic angle is a good place to start measuring.  \r\n2) The parietal pleural line (green) extends from the chest wall to the lung apex.  This line is in the middle third of the lung, where it intersects the bronchovascular markings.  This line is a good place to start measuring for pleural effusion.  The blunting of the costophrenic angle is a good place to start measuring. \r\n\r\nSo, we have two places to measure for pleural effusion, the costophrenic angle and the interlobar fissure.

Other causes include inflammation, infection, and post-surgical changes.  It is important to consider the differential diagnosis with the presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  Next, we need to consider the location of the enlargement (e.g. anterior, middle, posterior, or diffuse).  Previous imaging should be reviewed, and the clinical history should be elicited.  A thorough physical exam should be performed.  Finally, we need to consider the diagnostic test that will be most appropriate for this particular patient.

It is unlikely that the edema is seen on the AP film unless the patient has a significant amount of time to allow for the accumulation of fluid in the interstitial space.  The most common cause of CHF is left ventricular dysfunction.  The most common cause of left ventricular dysfunction is ischemic heart disease.  The most common cause of ischemic heart disease is atherosclerosis.  The most common cause of atherosclerosis is hyperlipidemia.  The most common cause of hyperlipidemia is a genetic predisposition.  This is the pathway by which most cases of CHF are caused.  There are other causes of CHF, but it is a good example of a cause which can be visualized on plain radiographs."

Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is caused by heart failure (most common cause), left to right shunts, and overcirculation.  It is important to remember that non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema can be seen in the setting of fulminant hepatic failure, acute renal failure, and sepsis.  The cause of the pulmonary edema is not always clear.  In this case, it is likely cardiogenic, due to the patient\u2019s recent 30-hour car ride.  The patient\u2019s heart rate is also indicative of cardiogenic edema; she has a rate of 142 bpm.  This is within the 120-150 range of a resting heart rate.  The brain\u2019s compensatory mechanism is to increase the heart rate to try and increase cardiac output. "

The first two findings are very obvious. The third finding is less obvious but still very important in determining the diagnosis. The silhouette sign is only seen when the ill-defined opacity is outlined by the more dense and opaque hemidiaphragm. If the opacity is not obscuring the right heart border, it is less likely to be silhouetted out by the hemidiaphragm. This is why step 2 is so important. If the first two findings are recognized, then the third finding is much more likely to be seen.
