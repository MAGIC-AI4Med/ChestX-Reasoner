Of note, there are two pleural fibrous layers: peripheral and central.  The peripheral pleura is a true pleura, while the central pleura is a visceral pleura.   \r\n\r\nThe normal lung, when collapsed, will lie flat against the chest wall, with the central pleura (visceral pleura) and the parietal pleura forming a triangular interface.   With a pneumothorax, the lung becomes progressively more convex, and at some point the visceral pleura will separate from the parietal pleura and the chest wall.   This is called a \"point of maximum insufflation,\" where the PMI is the maximum distance from the chest wall to the visceral pleura.   In this case, the PMI is at the right apex, as noted in the tech note.   The key is recognizing that the visceral pleura is lying flat against the chest wall."

This will usually be a \"common\" leakage, often near the connection with the PACK.   The second step is to look at the connection between the BATTERY PACK and the DELIVERY TUBE.  This is where the MANUAL is most helpful.   You should look at the DELIVERY TUBE and see if there are any obstructions or kinks (may need to be replaced).  The next step is to look at the connection between the DELIVERY TUBE and the CANNULUS.  This should be a simple connection (if it is not, there may be a problem).  The final step is to look at the connection between the CANNULUS and the NOSE TIP.  This connection should also be simple and free of any obstruction or kinks.  Once you have confirmed that there are no leaks and obstructions, you may then go to the next step of confirming the POSITION of the NOSE TIP in relation to the RADIUS OF THE EAR."

It is usually a specific disease or a group of diseases that can explain the radiologic findings. Here is a classic example: You see an adrenal mass on a plain X-ray.

This measurement should be 25-50% of the normal AP diameter of the lung.   If it is greater than 50%, there is a significant pneumothorax and the patient should be evaluated for signs of tension.  If it is less than 25%, it is likely a simple pneumothorax, and the radiologist can then move on to assessing for pneumothorax in the other two views."

If there is air in the mediastinum (hypothesis being tested), the two hemidiaphragms will be \"separated\" (thus the term \"sign\" is used). In other words, the two hemidiaphragms are not in close apposition (in fact, they are separated). The air in the mediastinum rises and pulls the two diaphragms apart. The two diaphragms are both \"spread\" out.   \r\n\r\nThe most common cause of a positive Cowley's sign is a perforation of the esophagus. Other causes include pericardial effusion, ruptured spleen, trauma, necrotizing fasciitis, or an aortic aneurysm."

Now that we have established that the lesion is a circular lesion that is located in the left hemithorax, let's think about the differential diagnosis.  The diagnosis is a pericardial cyst.  The differential would include a bronchogenic cyst, but these are usually located in the posteromedial aspect of the hemithorax adjacent to the posteromedial costal surface.

In the lateral view, the lung extends out further, and one can see the visceral pleura as a thin white line.  The radiologist saw the pneumothorax, and did not see any evidence of tension.  The patient had been supine (on his back, facing upwards), and the air had entered the pleural space and kept the lung from collapsing.  This is called the second lung-volume limit.  This occurs at about 25% of lung-volume.  A pneumothorax is not necessarily a sign of tension.  Chest pain, shortness of breath, and respiratory arrest can be signs of tension."

You may recall that pneumothorax is created by the presence of air in the pleural space.  The lung will always collapse toward the chest wall in the presence of a significant pneumothorax, regardless of whether it's left or right, up or down.  In this case, there is a small to moderate sized pneumothorax on the left side.  This is most likely due to a ruptured bleb in the lung from the laceration.  The second thing to look for is the absence of lung markings.  In this case, there are no lung markings peripheral to the 3rd rib in the left hemithorax.  There are several techniques for confirming a pneumothorax.  One is to count the ribs.  It is easy to count 3 ribs between the upper margin of the clavicle and the spine at the level of the 3rd rib.  You can do this by palpating the clavicle and the 3rd rib, and then sliding your finger down the chest to the spine.  3 ribs should be easily seen between these 2 bony landmarks.

There are 3 pathologic findings:\n1) Is there a lung marking present? 2) Is there an edge visible? and 3) Is there an angle visible? If you compare the lung to the edge and the angle, you can see that the lung extends further in the left hemithorax than the edge of the ribs. This means the lung is within the pleural space. Since we know the lung is not outside the pleural space (no pneumothorax) and we see the lung extends further than the edge of the ribs, then we can conclude the lung is within the pleural space. Since the lung is within the pleural space, there must be an equal amount of air outside the lung, causing the lucency (black) areas on either side of the lung. Since there is no sign of pneumothorax, the air outside the lung must be within the pleural space. Since the air is within the pleural space, it has to be either around the lung (within the visceral pleura) or around the ribs (within the parietal pleura). If the air was between the lung and ribs, it would be possible for the air to enter the soft tissues and cause the lucency (black) areas. However, since the air is between the lung and"

A simple pneumothorax is identified by the visible pleural line and the increased lucency of the space between the lung and chest wall. The visible pleural line is usually visible at the apex of the lung. The air in a simple pneumothorax usually flows inferiorly and, therefore, the space between the lung and chest wall is mostly empty. The air in a tension pneumothorax usually flows superiorly and, therefore, the space between the lung and chest wall is mostly air. If you see a pneumothorax, look for the following signs of tension:\r\n- The space between the two arrows\r\n- The trachea is shifted toward the opposite side\r\n- The affected side of the chest may appear hyperexpanded\r\n- The affected person may have difficulty breathing\r\nThe space between the two arrows represents the tension pneumothorax"

The atelectasis is due to compression of the middle lobe by the overlying bronchial tree and the pulmonary arteries.  This is usually transient and can be seen in the setting of bronchitis and pneumonia.  It is associated with mild to moderate volume loss and may be associated with some elevation of the hemidiaphragm.  It is a common radiographic finding in young children and is often found incidentally.  Complications include pneumonia and atelectasis.  Atelectasis in the horizontal fissure is usually an isolated abnormality, although in some patients the atelectasis may be more persistent.  There may be some association with left atrial enlargement.  This entity is sometimes confused with pneumothorax.  The major difference is that the atelectasis in the horizontal fissure usually crosses the entire fissure, whereas pneumothorax does not.  In addition, the pressure measured will be between 70-90 mm Hg, rather than the 10-15 mm Hg measured in pneumothorax.  The left hemidiaphragm is also"

If there is no air visible around the pleura, you should consider the other two lines visible in the chest x-ray. The second step is to look at the interlobar fissures. Are they visible? If they are visible, congratulations! You have just identified the major fissure. However, in most cases, the fissures are not visible, so you must proceed to the third and final step. The third and final step is to look at the medial border of the lung. Are you able to identify it? If it is visible, excellent! You have just identified the minor fissure. However, in most cases, the medial border of the lung is not visible, so you must proceed to the end. If you have reached this step, excellent! You have now identified the three lines visible in the chest x-ray. The minor fissure is"

You may recall that pneumothorax is created by the presence of air in the pleural space.  The lung will always collapse toward the chest wall in the presence of a significant pneumothorax, regardless of whether it is traumatic, pathologic, or spontaneous.  In this case, there is no pneumothorax.  You may recall that a linear density posterior to the sternum at the level of the vertebral bodies, along with a pleural line laterally, indicates the presence of fluid in the pleural space (pleural effusion).  This image shows both of these findings.  So, we are not looking for pneumothorax, but rather fluid in the pleural space.  What is the next step?  The radiologist should have noticed that in addition to fluid in the pleural space, there is also a slight increase in density in the left lung.  This is a clue to the diagnosis, because the left lung is the one that is collapsed.  So, the next step is to look for the cause of this collapse.  Is there any evidence of soft tissue in the left hemithorax?   The next step is to look for the cause of this collapse."

You may recall that pneumothorax is created by the presence of air in the pleural space.  The lung will always collapse toward the chest wall in the presence of a significant pneumothorax, regardless of whether it is traumatic, pathologic, or spontaneous.  In this case, there is no pneumothorax.  You may recall that a linear, thin, faintly radiopaque density over the mediastinum, near the aortic arch, is often misinterpreted as a pneumothorax.  This is often called the \"double bronchial wall sign\".  You should always look for the presence of a pneumothorax, and if you can not find it, you should look for a skin fold.  If you look at the CXR very carefully, you may see the \"double bronchial wall sign\" on the right side, near the aortic arch.  This is a sign of a pneumothorax.  You may also recall that a pneumothorax should have at least 3 cm of clear lung space between the lung and chest wall, and should never have lung markings beyond the pleural margin.  If you look"

        "pred": "The radiologist presented with a question about pneumothorax.  The first thing to look for in any CXR is a pneumothorax.  You may recall that pneumothorax is created by the presence of air in the pleural space.  The lung will always collapse toward the chest wall in the presence of a significant pneumothorax, regardless of whether it's left or right, up or down.  In this case, there is a small to moderate sized pneumothorax on the left side.  This is important because if there is a significant pneumothorax, the first thing to look for is the possible presence of tension.  This is a medical emergency that requires immediate intervention.  If there is no sign of tension, you can proceed to the second step. \nThe second step is to look for any evidence of collapse.  Recall that if there is air in the pleural space, the lung will always collapse against the chest wall.  In this case, there is a small to moderate sized pneumothorax on the left side but the lung does not appear to be collapsed.  In fact, the lung appears to be expanded- this is called an \"opposite pneumothorax.\"  This is a rare but well-known phenomenon.  The explanation for this is not completely understood but may"

Fibrosis within the pleural cavity. If you look at the left hemithorax, you will not see any air (negative), you will see the absence of black lung (negative), and the absence of pulmonary vessels (negative).  The absence of all three findings means that there is a white-out of the left hemithorax.  The differential diagnosis is fluid filled space that is opaque (hemothorax, exudate, transudate, amorphous), or fibrosis (fibrothorax, asbestothorax, post-radiation thorax, cystic bronchiectasis, sequelae of infection, congenital fibrothorax, post-operative thorax, hemothorax, exudate, transudate, amorphous).  The differential diagnosis is not pleural effusion.  The pleural effusion is usually seen as an anechoic, compressible, non-adherent, and with low viscosity fluid. \n\nReferences:\n1.
