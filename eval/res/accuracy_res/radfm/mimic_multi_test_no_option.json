Infiltrates, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, and nodules can all be identified on the frontal chest radiograph.  The second thing to look for is any abnormality in the mediastinum. This includes the mediastinal contour, which should be symmetric. Also, the heart size and configuration are important.  The third thing to look for are any abnormalities in the bones. This includes looking at the bones of the chest, the ribs, the spine, and the clavicles. The bones can be evaluated for fractures, bone loss, or any abnormal shape.  The fourth thing to look for are any abnormalities in the soft tissues. This includes looking at the soft tissue in the neck, the chest, and the axilla.  Finally, the fifth thing to look for is any abnormality in the patient's identification. This includes the patient's name, medical record number, date of birth, and date of the examination. "

If the baby had a chest X-ray performed with a marker on the area of pain, and a wormian bone was noted there, then that would be the definitive diagnosis.  But, since the radiographic findings are within normal limits, we must consider other causes of chest pain in a young person.  Viral illness with \"bony\" erosion of the ribs from a rheumatologic cause could cause pain, as could a musculoskeletal condition.  A bony lytic lesion vs. aggressive healing might also cause pain.  There are many causes of chest pain in a young person.  If the clinical presentation is consistent with the radiographic findings of a wormian bone, then that is the diagnosis.  But, since the radiographic findings are vague, the differential diagnosis is broad."

Lung may completely collapse. Mediastinum should not shift away from the pneumothorax unless a tension pneumothorax is present. Subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum may also be present. Methods for estimating the percentage volume of pneumothorax from an erect PA radiograph include Collins method % = 4. 2 + 4. 7 (A + B + C), where A, B, and C are interpleural distances at different levels. Rhea method. Light index. In cases where a pneumothorax is not clearly present on standard frontal chest radiography, other techniques can be employed Lateral decubitus radiograph Should be done with the suspected side up, and the lung will \"fall\" away from the chest wall. Expiratory chest radiograph Lung becomes smaller and denser, making the pneumothorax more conspicuous. ,\nThe answer is Yes."

If there is a finding, the second step is to determine if it is a \"focal\" or \"diffuse\" abnormality.  Focal abnormalities are limited to a specific area of the chest, often described as a focal bulge along a vascular line.  Examples include a mass, atelectasis, or a hematoma.  If the finding is diffuse, it is described as a large, smooth, generalized bulge of the interstitium.  This is often caused by fluid accumulation in the pleural space, pulmonary edema, or hemorrhage.  If the CXR is abnormal, the next step is to determine if it is a \"chest wall\" or \"mediastinal\" abnormality.  Chest wall abnormalities often cause a focal bulge along a vascular line, while mediastinal abnormalities often cause a diffuse bulge in the soft tissue along the mediastinum.  Common chest wall abnormalities include a rib fracture, a chest wall hematoma, or a pleural effusion.  Mediastinal abnormalities often result in a mediastinal mass, which is a collection of fluid, blood, or swol"

The inner margin is often well-defined because it is tangential to the x-ray beam and the adjacent lung is a good contrast medium. The tapering outer margin is indistinct as it is en face to the x-ray beam and the chest wall provides less tissue contrast. Calcified plaques are more obvious than non-calcified plaques to be identified. Locations most commonly encountered include posterolateral, mediastinal, and diaphragmatic pleura. The appearance of plaques has been likened to that of a holly leaf, with thickened rolled and nodular edges.\nThe answer is Yes."

This may represent collapse of the right middle lobe (RML).

Lung may completely collapse. Mediastinum should not shift away from the pneumothorax unless a tension pneumothorax is present. Subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum may also be present. Methods for estimating the percentage volume of pneumothorax from an erect PA radiograph include Collins method % = 4. 2 + 4. 7 (A + B + C), where A, B, and C are interpleural distances at different levels. Rhea method. Light index. In cases where a pneumothorax is not clearly present on standard frontal chest radiography, other techniques can be employed Lateral decubitus radiograph Should be done with the suspected side up, and the lung will \"fall\" away from the chest wall.

This may lead to the detection of a soft tissue lesion, or a bone lesion, which may be related to the underlying disease.

The patient has a history of a pulmonary embolism, and therefore, pulmonary embolism should be on the differential, even though the prior CT showed no pulmonary embolism.   \n\nThe normal hematocrit sign and absence of leukocytosis suggest the diagnosis of CHF. The radiograph shows a \"flask-shaped\" appearance of the cardiac shadow. This is due to the resorption of the interstitial fluid in the alveoli, which causes an increased radiolucency of the left heart border. This is known as the \"batwing\" sign. The batwing sign is seen in 30-50% of patients with CHF, and is seen in approximately 75% of patients with interstitial pulmonary edema.  The radiograph also shows a central vein and artery enlargement and a secondary pulmonary edema pattern. The heart is enlarged, and the pulmonary vasculature is dilated and indistinct. The patient has no pleural effusions, and therefore, the CHF is non-cardiogenic. This is known as \"rope-like edema.\" Rope"

The differential would include diffuse pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, eosinophilic pneumonia, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and acute interstitial or alveolar pneumonia.  The presence of ground glass opacities would narrow the differential to the diseases mentioned above, with the exception of acute interstitial or alveolar pneumonia.  Acute interstitial or alveolar pneumonia would not be a first choice because there is no history of risk factors for these diseases and because the radiograph does not show a single area of focal consolidation.  Eosinophilic pneumonia is unlikely because it is not associated with ground glass opacities.  Diffuse pulmonary edema is associated with smooth septal thickening and patchy coalescing airspace opacities.  Acute respiratory distress syndrome is associated with diffuse bilateral perihilar ground glass and reticular opacities.  Finally, chronic interstitial lung disease is associated with reticular opacities and honeycombing.  Therefore, the presence of ground glass opacities"

The catheter should be continuous and smooth, with no evidence of disruption or kinking. The location of the catheter tip should also be evaluated, as it can migrate over time. The catheter tip should be in a central location, and should not be in contact with lung tissue or against the chest wall.

Transudate occurs due to fluid overload (CHF, nephrosis, congestive heart failure, etc.); and, exudate occurs due to inflammation, infection, or neoplasm. In this case, there is a likely exudate, as there are multiple possible causes of a non-loculated pleural effusion. \r\n\r\nThe second step is to determine the three most likely causes of the effusion. This will narrow down the differential significantly. In this case, the top three most likely causes are: A) malignancy (primary or metastatic); B) empyema; or, C) hemothorax."

The mnemonic CARDIAC is a useful tool for organizing the causes of cardiomegaly and narrowing down the differential.
