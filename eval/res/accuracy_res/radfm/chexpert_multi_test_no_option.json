Lung may completely collapse. Mediastinum should not shift away from the pneumothorax unless a tension pneumothorax is present. Subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum may also be present. Methods for estimating the percentage volume of pneumothorax from an erect PA radiograph include Collins method % = 4. 2 + 4. 7 (A + B + C), where A, B, and C are interpleural distances at different levels. Rhea method. Light index. In cases where a pneumothorax is not clearly present on standard frontal chest radiography, other techniques can be employed Lateral decubitus radiograph Should be done with the suspected side up, and the lung will \"fall\" away from the chest wall.

The chest radiograph is non-specific, meaning it is not able to differentiate the various causes of interstitial lung disease. However, there are certain characteristic patterns of interstitial lung disease on chest radiographs. These patterns are based on the distribution of fibrosis and inflammation in the lungs. The first step is to look at the distribution of fibrosis and inflammation. Is the fibrosis uniform (such as in sarcoidosis) or is it asymmetric (such as in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or systemic sclerosis)? Is the inflammation focal (such as in hypersensitivity pneumonitis) or is it diffuse (such as in sarcoidosis). Based on the image, the underlying pattern of interstitial lung disease can be narrowed down, and the differential diagnosis can be made. However, further diagnostic tests, such as lung biopsy or blood tests, may be required to make the definitive diagnosis."

Chest tube placement is one of the most common indications for obtaining a CXR.  \r\n\r\nThe classic finding for pneumothorax is the deep sulcus sign.  In the setting of chest pain, this sign is often accompanied by a visibly pneumothorax-sized lung.  The deep sulcus sign is lost with the placement of a chest tube.

If you have already identified a large pulmonary embolus, it's important to look for signs of right heart strain.

The term interstitial lung disease encompasses a variety of disorders, which are characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the lung tissue, resulting in decreased lung function. The chest radiograph is the initial imaging modality to evaluate these disorders. The most common interstitial lung diseases include SLE, Scleroderma, Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, Cystic Fibrosis, Sarcoidosis, and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis. The diagnostic dilemma is to recognize the early stage of interstitial lung disease on chest radiograph when there is no or minimal fibrosis. The key to this problem is recognition of the linear and reticular opacities that are seen earliest. These abnormalities are seen before there is a loss of lung volume (fibrosis) or before there is honeycombing. The linear and reticular opacities are usually associated with ground-glass opacities. The most common pattern is a reticular pattern that is often characterized as a diffuse reticular pattern or as a lower lobe predominant pattern. The linear opacities are often characterized as thickened septal lines or lines in the lingula.  The differential diagnosis for these abnormalities"

This case shows a necrotizing infection of the lymph node with cavitation.  Remember, you can see the cavitation because it is fluid density.  With the fluid density, it is important to look for an abscess.  An abscess is a collection of pus that is usually surrounded by an enhancing wall.  If there is no wall, then it is just a necrotic lymph node.  In this case, it is a necrotizing infection of the lymph node with cavitation.  The last thing to look for is a soft tissue mass that is round and has an enhancing wall.  This is usually a malignancy.  If you are unsure, you can always ask \"Is this the most likely diagnosis for this patient at this age?\"  If the answer is no, then you should look for other conditions that are most likely."

Visible visceral pleural edge is seen as a very thin, sharp white line. No lung markings are seen peripheral to this line. Peripheral space is radiolucent compared to the adjacent lung. Lung may completely collapse. Mediastinum should not shift away from the pneumothorax unless a tension pneumothorax is present. Subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum may also be present. Methods for estimating the percentage volume of pneumothorax from an erect PA radiograph include Collins method % = 4. 2 + 4. 7 (A + B + C), where A, B, and C are interpleural distances at different levels. Rhea method. Light index. In cases where a pneumothorax is not clearly present on standard frontal chest radiography, other techniques can be employed Lateral decubitus radiograph Should be done with the suspected side up, and the lung will \"fall\" away from the chest wall. Expiratory chest radiograph Lung becomes smaller and denser, making the pneumothorax more conspicuous. ,\nThe answer is Yes."

Second, break down the abnormality into its components. Third, think about the differentials and compare with your differentials. Fourth, make a plan to approach the diagnosis and management. The Reticular Interstitial Pattern is a subtle, bilateral reticular pattern without honeycombing. It is seen in HRCT as a diffuse reticular pattern with irregular thickening and thinning of the interlobular septa. The pattern is caused by patchy areas of intralobular septal thickening and associated areas with thinning. This is in contradistinction to NSIP, where the thickening is predominantly in the lower perilobular and peripheral areas. The pattern may be associated with other patterns (e. g. GGO) and may be seen in the absence of honeycombing. It has been reported to be associated with worse prognosis. Type 821 - pulmonary fibrosis with reticulationsThe diagnosis is Reticular interstitial pattern."

Finally, you can look for a consolidation (a \"region of the lung that is filled with fluid and/or pus\") caused by alveolar edema.  This consolidation is usually in a perihilar pattern, and it may be bilateral or unilateral.  If you have already identified a pneumothorax, you can stop there - you do not need to keep looking for any other abnormalities.  The differential diagnosis is broad for a hemodynamically stable patient with a pneumothorax, but the vast majority of cases are caused by a ruptured bleb from a lung cyst.  The second most common cause is a ruptured bulla from emphysema (usually apical).  Other causes include barotrauma from mechanical ventilation, penetrating trauma to the chest, and iatrogenic causes such as a misplaced chest tube."

The term interstitial lung disease encompasses a variety of disorders, which are characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the lung tissue, resulting in decreased lung function. The chest radiograph is non-specific, meaning it is not able to differentiate the various causes of interstitial lung disease. However, there are certain characteristic patterns of interstitial lung disease on chest radiographs. These patterns are based on the distribution of fibrosis and inflammation in the lungs. The first step is to look at the distribution of fibrosis and inflammation. Is the fibrosis uniform (such as in sarcoidosis) or is it asymmetric (such as in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or systemic sclerosis)? Is the inflammation focal (such as in hypersensitivity pneumonitis) or is it diffuse (such as in sarcoidosis). Based on the image, the underlying pattern of interstitial lung disease can be narrowed down, and the differential diagnosis can be made. However, further diagnostic tests, such as lung biopsy or blood tests, may be required to make the definitive diagnosis."

In fact, the absence of lung markings in the lung apex is usually the most striking feature.  Other features of pneumothorax, such as mediastinal shift, are not as consistent.

        "pred": "The Radiographic features can be summarized as follows. A pneumothorax is usually easily appreciated on erect chest radiographs. Visible visceral pleural edge is seen as a very thin, sharp white line. No lung markings are seen peripheral to this line. Peripheral space is radiolucent compared to the adjacent lung. Lung may completely collapse. Mediastinum should not shift away from the pneumothorax unless a tension pneumothorax is present. Subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum may also be present. Methods for estimating the percentage volume of pneumothorax from an erect PA radiograph include Collins method % = 4. 2 + 4. 7 (A + B + C), where A, B, and C are interpleural distances at different levels. Rhea method. Light index. In cases where a pneumothorax is not clearly present on standard frontal chest radiography, other techniques can be employed Lateral decubitus radiograph Should be done with the suspected side up, and the lung will \"fall\" away from the chest wall. Expiratory chest radiograph Lung becomes smaller and denser, making the pneumothorax more conspicuous. ,\nThe answer is Yes."
