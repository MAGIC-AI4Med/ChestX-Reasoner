Pulmonary contusion is a hematoma within the lung parenchyma, caused by direct chest trauma.  The contusion may be due to compressive atelectasis of the lung with increased intra-alveolar pressures.  Pulmonary contusion may be seen on CXR as ill defined or well defined opacities, generally with a convex border.  They are typically found in the periphery of the lung, and are often seen in conjunction with rib fracture.  Contusions may also cause increased bronchovascular markings.  They are commonly seen in the presence of flail chest, and may be bilateral or unilateral.  Cystic bronchiectasis is a finding associated with long standing contusions."

Infiltrates usually show some peripheral focal areas.  In cardiomegaly there is an enlargement of the heart.  But where is the edema?  There is no pleural effusion.  Remember that CHF can also cause cardiomegaly and that the liver may also demonstrate edema in the cases of CHF, but the presentation here is very unusual."

There should be a straight line visible between the carina and the cardiac apex. Is there? Step 2: Look at the lateral view. Look for the posterior location of the right pericardial fat pad. Is there? Step 3: Look at both frontal and lateral views. What is the diagnosis? Frontal view: Left lower lobe triangular opacity (thymic sail sign) and absence of right pericardial fat pad. Lateral view: posterior location of the right pericardial fat pad. The above findings are seen in the first 24 hours of life in 50% of babies. It is the most common cause of neonatal cardiomegaly. If a baby has these findings, it does not necessarily have to be a diagnosis of congestive heart failure. It can be a normal physiological finding. However, the clinical presentation, and the presence of other factors such as maternal history of heart disease during pregnancy, may indicate the need to perform an echocardiogram to rule out congestive heart failure."

Pneumonia is usually seen as a region of consolidation, often with a rounded shape.  It is important to look for any pneumonia, and if found, it is important to look for any underlying causes.  One common cause of pneumonia is aspiration, which often causes bilateral pneumonia with a symmetrical distribution.  Enlarged cardiomediastinum is often seen on CXR, and is due to the heart being displaced by atelectatic or collapsed lung.

If they are seen, it is important to describe their location, direction, and relationship to other structures, such as other tubes or the patient's heart.  This will help you later on in your differential diagnostic list.  Remember, the radiology technologist is responsible for ensuring that these devices are in correct position, and therefore, it is important to describe their location in relation to other structures.\r\n\r\n2) Consolidation.

There are many causes for homogeneous opacification of the lung fields, but in this case, it is the result of airspace filling. The air in the alveoli is replaced with fluid or pus, and the lumen is filled with material that cannot be seen on plain radiographs.  The second finding is the loss of the normal half-moon overlap of the hemidiaphragm. This is a result of the fluid in the pleural space ascending and replacing the lung tissue. The third finding is the meniscus sign. This is seen as a triangular lucency at the lung-pleural interface. The fourth finding is the loss of the vascular marking. This is caused by the fluid in the pleural space displacing the blood vessels. The fifth finding is the loss of the right heart border. This is caused by the same fluid in the pleural space displacing the vascular markings. The sixth finding is the increased interstitial markings. This is caused by the bronchovascular markings being more prominent as a result of crowding of the vessels in the pleural space."

A good rule is to consider the most likely diagnosis first, then work backwards.  So if you are looking at a chest X-ray that is normal, you should consider the most common diagnosis, which is atelectasis.  In this case, there is a pulmonary mass present, which is not the most common finding.  The other findings, a pleural effusion, pneumothorax, and pulmonary mass are not within the top five most common findings.  So, we should consider a pulmonary mass as the least common finding.

But, there is no Z sign, so the air bronchogram is absent.  Which is correct.  \r\n\r\nThe correct answer is \"pneumonia\".  This is a well known triangular shaped opacity, known as the Hampton's hump.  This is a complication of pulmonary embolism, but can also be seen in pneumonia.  The pulmonary artery is occluded by an embolism, and the arterial pressure is maintained via the Hampton's hump - which is a dilated branch of the descending thoracic aorta."

There is a loss of the descending aortic interface.   Look at the left upper border of the mediastinum; it is lost.  There is an ill-defined interface between the left upper lobe and left upper mediastinum.  There is also a loss of the interface between the descending aorta and the left heart border.

Lobar collapse will have a more typical appearance based on the lobe involved, whereas atelectasis can be more eccentric in position and appearance.  Atelectasis is generally confined to a lobe or segment of a lobe, whereas complete lobar collapse will tend to involve all the lung tissue in that lobe.  There can be significant overlap in appearance between lobar collapse and atelectasis, and the two conditions should be considered in the context of the patient clinically.  \r\n\r\nThe next step is to assess the patient for support devices.  This includes intravenous lines (such as an intravenous cannula), oxygen masks, nasogastric tubes, ETT (endotracheal tubes), and any other tubes or catheters in the chest region.

You can do this by simply explaining that cardiomegaly is a condition where the heart is enlarged beyond its normal size.  This can be easily demonstrated by showing the patient how to place both of their hands on their heart and how to determine if their hand is flat or not.  If the patient has a hard time understanding what you mean, then it is a good idea to get a family member or close friend to demonstrate the finding for the patient.

        "pred": "First, we need to identify the lung markings. This is a chest x-ray, so it should have a relatively high density (white) on the front part of the body and a low density (black) on the back. In the case of a normal chest x-ray, there should be a balance between the white and black areas, with perhaps a slight predominance of the white area (the lungs).  There should be a reason why this is so. If you think about it, the x-ray beam has to pass through the entire chest in order to get a clear image of the front part. The more \"solid\" the chest content, the more the beam will be blocked, and the less clear the image will be.  In the case of a pneumothorax, there is an increase in the area of black (the air is black on the x-ray), and the amount of white (the lung markings) decreases.  This imbalance is easily seen by the naked eye. If you look carefully, you will also see that there are slightly more white areas on the left side.  This is due to the fact that there is less lung markings on the left side, caused by the fact that the air is predominantly on the left side.  There is no space on the right side to hold the air, so it is predominantly on the left side."

The single lung is dark, as it is collapsed.  There may be areas of increased lucency, as the air becomes trapped.  The lung is unable to expand to fill the hemithorax, and may appear wavy.  The intercostal spaces are not uniform, and the lung does not transmit breath sounds.  This is the result of air leakage out of the airways, with the air becoming trapped.

These are generally obvious and if they are not, the patient may not be stable at this point.  Next, the lungs are scanned.  Are there any consolidation (with or without air bronchograms), ground glass opacities, interstial opacities, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or atelectasis?  Are there any masses or calcifications seen?  This is where the fine details of the image come into play.  The film should be adjusted to the appropriate exposure so that there are no undue intensities or dark spots visible.  Are there any areas of increased lucency between the ribs?  These areas could be due to a number of causes such as atelectasis, scarring, or pleural effusion.

This can be a cause for concern in a patient who has sustained a myocardial infarction, or in a patient who presents with chest pain and a history of coronary artery disease.  The left heart border is the one we focus on, since it is the most accurately discernible.  \r\n\r\nThe second finding is an enlarged cardiomediastinum.  This includes the left and right heart borders.  It is important to note that an enlarged cardiomediastinum can be a normal finding in younger individuals, and in those with a history of intense physical exercise the night before.  It is important to correlate with the patient's history and physical examination.  A large cardiomediastinal shadow is a cause for concern in a patient with chest pain, as a myocardial infarction is the most common cause for a ruptured pericardium.\r\n\r\nThe third finding is a pneumothorax.  This is a cause for concern in anyone who has sustained trauma, or in those who are intubated.  It is important to note that a simple pneumothorax is not necessarily a cause for concern, as many of us have experienced a simple pneumothorax after a chest tube was"

The radiologist/radiographer must also be aware of the clinical changes in the patient, since the interpretation of the pneumothorax finding is dependent on the patient's condition at the time.   For example, a small pneumothorax in a well patient may not be clinically significant, whereas the same finding in a patient with cystic fibrosis may be very significant.  The radiologist/radiographer is the one who must make the final decision as to the management of the finding, but the clinical team is responsible for the welfare of the patient, and must communicate with the radiologist/radiographer as to the clinical status of the patient."

However, the most common causes in adults are cardiomyopathy, pericardial effusion, and heart valve disease.  The left atrium is most commonly affected.  The right ventricle can also be enlarged in some cases.  The main differential is to differentiate cardiomegaly from pericardial effusion.  This is done by measuring the cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) on a PA chest X-ray.  The CTR is the ratio of:\r\ncardiac diameter / thoracic diameter\r\nThe normal CTR is less than 0. 5.  If there is a pericardial effusion, the CTR will be greater than 0. 5.  However, there are exceptions to this rule.  If the X-ray is done in an AP view, then the CTR can be greater than 0. 5 and still be normal.  In this case, there is no pericardial effusion (please see discussion below).  After ruling out a pericardial effusion, the radiologist looks at the contour of the left atrium.  If there are no signs of cardiomegaly, the radiologist looks for an infiltrative process or an"

This can be seen in conditions such as aortic stenosis, and is a compensatory mechanism used by the heart to increase its contractility.  The next thing to look for is an enlarged cardiomediastinum.  An enlarged cardiomediastinum can be caused by many things, including left ventricular hypertrophy.  The most common cause of an enlarged cardiomediastinum, however, is pericardial effusion.  Pericardial effusion causes fluid to accumulate in the pericardial cavity, which can be visualized on chest radiographs by the water bottle sign.  The third finding is atelectasis.  Atelectasis is a condition where there is reduced or absent gas exchange at the lung base.  This is most commonly caused by compression of the lung bases by pleural effusions.

In the chest X-ray, we see that the pleural effusion is located in the left basilar region.  But, what is the cause of the pleural effusion?  Again, we need to look at the entire chest X-ray.  There is a white-out of the left basilar region with air bronchograms.  This may be due to an area of consolidation in the lung.

It is difficult to track these wires completely through the image, but they clearly are in the chest wall.  There is a small apical left pneumothorax, with a pleural reflection indicated by the arrow. There is a chest tube in place, with a small amount of pleural effusion.  \r\n\r\nThe last finding is subtle, and may be difficult to identify without careful review. There is an area of increased lucency\r\nunder the right hemidiaphragm. This is shown by the red arrow. It is important to recognize this finding, because it suggests a significant amount of air in the peritoneal cavity. This is compatible with a perforation, and a common cause of significant pneumoperitoneum. It is not, however, compatible with gastric air. The radiographic appearance is non-specific, and further evaluation with a CT or UGI is required."

Next, we look for a contour abnormality of the left hemidiaphragm.  There is a sloping contour of the left hemidiaphragm.  This is called the \"double contour\" sign.

However, the most important finding is the fact that there is no pneumothorax.  This is important because there is no evidence of air leakage into the chest cavity.  This is a very important finding because it indicates that there is no major injury to the lungs, bronchi, or chest wall.  So, the final answer is \"No finding\"."

There are other signs of consolidation, such as ground glass opacities, wedge shaped changes, or pleural effusions.  The location is not specific for lobar consolidation.

We have a number of findings that are very specific for certain diseases.  However, these findings are not very common.  On the other hand, there are a number of findings that are not specific at all.  It is important to put all the findings together to come up with a preliminary diagnosis.  Then you can start to think about the most likely cause.  This is where the clinical presentation, the patient's medical history, and the radiographic findings all come together."
